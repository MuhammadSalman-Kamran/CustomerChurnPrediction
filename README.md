# Customer Churn Prediction for Subscription-based Services

![Alt](https://github.com/MuhammadSalman-Kamran/CustomerChurnPrediction/blob/main/dataset-cover.png)

## Overview

This project focuses on churn prediction, a critical task for businesses seeking to retain customers. Churn, or customer attrition, occurs when customers cease using a service or stop purchasing a product. Understanding and predicting churn is crucial for maintaining a healthy customer base and ensuring business growth. This project aims to employ data analysis and machine learning to predict customer churn.

## Data

The project utilizes a dataset that includes various customer attributes, such as geographic information, gender, activity status, and more. The target variable, "Exited," indicates whether a customer has churned (1) or not (0). The dataset undergoes thorough exploratory data analysis, statistical analysis, and preprocessing to ensure its suitability for machine learning.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

The initial stages of the project involve exploring the dataset's statistics, distributions, and correlations. Visualizations, such as box plots and pair plots, provide insights into the data, highlighting patterns and relationships that influence churn prediction. Outlier detection and handling are also performed to improve model accuracy.

## Data Preprocessing

Categorical variables are encoded, and the dataset is split into training and testing sets. Feature scaling is applied to ensure the models' robustness. The project employs three machine learning algorithms for churn prediction: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting. The models are evaluated for their accuracy, precision, and recall in predicting customer churn.

## Model Tuning

The Random Forest model is further fine-tuned using GridSearchCV to optimize its hyperparameters. The goal is to enhance its predictive performance, leading to more accurate churn predictions.

## Results

The project's results include the accuracy and performance metrics of the machine learning models used for churn prediction. It provides an actionable understanding of customer attrition, allowing businesses to make informed decisions and implement targeted retention strategies.

## Usage

This project's code and models can be leveraged to predict churn in your own customer datasets. The README file includes detailed instructions on running the code and adapting it for your specific data.

Contributions and suggestions for improvement are welcome. Feel free to submit pull requests or open issues if you have ideas for enhancing the churn prediction models or the project as a whole.

## Acknowledgments

This project was developed as part of a data science and machine learning course. Special thanks to the course instructors and contributors for their guidance and insights.

Maintaining customer loyalty is essential for any business. We hope this project helps you achieve that goal effectively.
